Microsoft Azure has a lot of powerful features, especially for large-scale enterprises.
The cloud infrastructure is robust and the security measures are top-notch. 
However, I found the interface quite complicated to navigate initially, and the pricing model is a bit confusing. I also experienced some downtime during high-traffic periods.
But overall, it does the job well for our business.
